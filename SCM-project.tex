\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Topic}
This report is about helping a small but growing company with a low budget and without previous SCM experience to adopt SCM. The company today suffers from the common problems that a proper SCM implementation would solve. What is relevant is how to convince the company that SCM is needed and that it would save them time, effort and money. 

\noindent Further we will put together a tailored implementation plan for the company to increase their productivity and during this process we will address some of the common pitfalls and provide a sustainable solution where both current and future circumstances are taken into account.

\noindent Kanske kan nämna något mer om How, What and When också? Framförallt måste vi avgränsa oss till typ 3 problemställningar som vi sen kan dela upp sinsemellan?

\section{Background}
\subsection{PonteVecchio Software Biography}
The company which is target for this project is called PonteVecchio Software. PonteVecchio has grown from 2 to 15 developers over the last 10 years, and has never used any type of versioning or configuration management. Their software has been backed up to CDs each time it has been sent to a customer, but they do not support the older versions, or any other version for that matter.

\noindent PonteVecchio Software started out as a small software firm with two Computer Science students as their founders, John and Adam. Their first projects was a small back end service for a web server which they sold directly to other developers. The service was a moderate success and motivated John and Adam to hire some more people and take on new challenges. Now 10 years later, PonteVecchio has 4 products which their 15 developers ship to customers:
\begin{itemize}
\item A task manager app for keeping schedules and todo list. This app is developed in two versions, both as a regular desktop application and a mobile application. Both share a high degree of code base. 
\item An online password manager where users can store all their login information online. This system requires a high level of security verification.
\item An enterprise version of their scheduling app that was specifically ordered by a company. This version is highly customized and does not share a lot of code base with the standard application. It does however use some Open Source developed modules that the company requires for integration with their systems. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent Since the enterprise customers are very demanding and comes up with new modifications and requirements, the developers have chosen to work agile and uses monthly scrum sessions. In the end of each scrum they will do a new release which is evaluated by the customers and developed further in the next sprint.

\noindent Up until now all projects and its modules has been shared either via a local server in the office or via email, with each developer being responsible for their own share. This has severely hurt their productivity since the possibility of concurrent development is very limited. 

\noindent Today John is the one that knows the organization best and has tried to keep up with what is happening in every project and what the others are currently working on. John is also the one with most panic to get the SCM in place before something catastrophic could happen. Therefore John is eager on taking the role of a CM manager. John is the one who suggested taking on SCM, even though he himself has very limited knowledge of SCM and how it works.

\noindent Adam often do experiments on new features and wants to try them out before implementing them to the main repository, he therefore would like to have his own environment to do his experiments on. PonteVecchio has a steady revenue from these product but their margins are slim and they need to keep costs down, therefore John also desires a system that is highly cost-effective to implement, both in terms of price and time effort. 

\noindent The Quality Assurance or QA are currently low on resources and more or less all of the developers acts as QA. Hence it’s not uncommon that errors are delivered to the customer and since some parts of the system are security critical the traceability of changes made between releases are as important as the possibility to rollback and reproduce a stable version in this scenario.

\noindent The company's future looks bright and is about to hire new personnel in a near future but wants their SCM implementation to be in place before new people gets involved. Therefore the SCM setup we will implement must be future compatible with more people along with separated departments and teams for the different projects. Further the responsibility for the different modules must be easy to split between the developers.

\section{Problem statement}

\hfill \break
\noindent Some of the problems of this report are  listed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item How are we going to convince the stakeholders to adopt SCM if they have survived almost completely without it so far? In other words what are the greatest benefits of SCM?
\item How will it be possible to introduce SCM if the company is already on a tight budget?
\item What are the difficulties in order to implement SCM to a company new to SCM?
\item Are additional people needed in the company to handle SCM and what properties are we looking for when choosing someone to be responsible for SCM?
\item Which branching pattern, synchronization model and SCM tool will be the most suitable for PonteVecchio considered the high demand for traceability and security verification within a reasonable budget?
\item How can we help the company to maintain a sustainable SCM after the basic implementation is finished?
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Convince management /CJ}

\subsection{Branching pattern/JL}
\subsubsection{Optimal branching for Parallel Development}
The main question here is how branching should be performed in order to obtain maximum efficiency during parallel work. 

\noindent Our definition of not having any branches would be that no branches are allowed, not even local ones in the workspace. This would mean that everyone would be working on the original files in the repository. We have discussed that parallel work would be very difficult in such a scenario, as everyone would be intruding into each other space, braking each others code.

\noindent We have discussed that not having any branches would also mean bad security and reproducibility. With bad security, we mean that we can not go back to a previous version of our released software. This can be problematic because if our new revision have more bugs than our old, we can't do a diff between the new and the old version to find the bug, because we did not branch the old version. Reproducibility would be nonexistent without any branches, as the only version we have is the one we are working on.

\noindent It is obvious that branches are needed in order to work efficiently, both in terms of parallel work and after release product support. How is our branching strategy supposed to be in order to reach optimum results in these fields?

\noindent We have discussed that the optimum branching strategy for a project where there is parallel work is to have a local branch for each member in the team (in his/hers workspace) in order to isolate changes. The reader may ask, why is it necessary to isolate changes? The answer is that isolation of changes is needed in order for each developer to choose when he/she shall be struck by the other developers changes. This will give the developer time to prepare for whatever impact the other developers changes will have on his/her changes.

\noindent Now some attentive readers may scream "this will introduce the simultaneous update problem!". Now this is correct that the simultaneous update problem will be present with such a solution, but it is our SCM tools duty to detect these conflicts. The last person to integrate will be the one who will have to solve the merge conflicts, which will indirectly motivate the developers to integrate as often as possible.

\noindent We have discussed that one branch for every release is needed to reach optimum reproducibility of problems that customers may have. This is a necessity, because the customer may use old hardware, which is not capable of running the latest version of the software.

\noindent Appleton \cite{Appleton} has mentioned two different branching styles ("Early Branching" and "Deferred Branching"). Early branching is obviously the branching method that suits best into our earlier reasoning, hence this is our branching method of choice to introduce to PonteVecchio. 

\subsubsection{Recommended Merging style/JL}
\noindent According to Appleton \cite{Appleton} the choice of merging style often (but not always) follows from the chosen branching style.

\noindent We recommend continuous merging, that means merging whenever a task is completed. Therefore we recommend the merging pattern "Merge Early and often" \cite{Appleton}. We think that a relatively small company like PonteVecchio would have no problems to merge changes as soon as they are done, therefore we all agree that this model would be optimal. We agree that too many changes at once would mean that the development has to be halted in order to integrate the changes. Everyone that has taken the SCM course will probably agree that the merging is too infrequent if programmers can be given a week off while others are integrating the changes.

\subsubsection{How to handle variants?/JL}
Since the application that PonteVeccio develops has a mobile version and a desktop version, it is inevitable to not have any variants in the company. The main question in this subtopic is how are we going to handle these variants in the best possible way?

\noindent The two main variant management methods that we debated could be of use to the project was the variant segregation method and the single source variation method \cite{Mahler}. Our final choice fell on the variant segregation model due to the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item PonteVeccio is a fairly small company, but the project is still enormous for one person to overview. Using the single source variation variant method would probably stall the developers often, due to the drawback that the code is harder to read.
\item The risk of redundancy (also known as the double maintenance problem\cite{Babich}) is the main drawback of the variant segregation model. We have discussed that the impact of this drawback is not a big concern, since we only have two variants (desktop and mobile). It would be an entirely different story if we had hundreds of variants. Since the common functionality is located outside the variants, one may get the idea to just fix the bug reports that were reported in each separate version, and ignore it in the other until someone reports it there as well. Our conclusion is that we would not recommend such a strategy for PonteVeccio, otherwise the mobile and the desktop version that were intended to be similar to each other, will drift too far apart in terms of functionality. We therefore recommend PonteVeccio to live with the double maintenance problem in this case.

\end{itemize}
\noindent
\subsubsection{When to make a baseline?/JL}
We recommend PonteVeccio to establish baselines whenever there are enough change requests to make it worthwhile to establish a new baseline. If for example a critical fix is needed, one shall not be foolish and establish a new baseline just for that purpose. Instead, one should fix the issue as soon as possible and not waste time on other things.

\noindent We all agree that it is a good idea to establish a baseline for every new release of the product. Baselines related to releases will come in handy when trying to reproduce an old configuration at a later point in time.

\noindent We also agree that separate baselines for variants may be needed. In PonteVeccios case, we agree that separate baselines are needed, as the software has a mobile version and a desktop version. The mobile version may have a higher emphasis on being as resource efficient as possible, whereas the desktop version may have other priorities.

\subsubsection{How to accomplish reproducibility?/JL}
\noindent Since the application that PonteVeccio is developing is an Enterprise scheduling app, with on-line functionality, it is a distributed system. In distributed systems, it is unfortunately not easy to ensure reproducibility \cite{Bays}, as some dependencies throughout the network may change. We can however put the reproducibility odds to our advantage by by saving all the released file versions, the baselines and the documents associated with each release.

\section{Conclusion}

First of all we’ll need to convince the importance of SCM to the management of PonteVecchio, this can be done for example by highlighting some of their current problems that a proper SCM implementation would solve.

\noindent Since PonteVecchio are completely unfamiliar to SCM we’ll need to setup a SCM implementation plan tailored for their needs. We’ll also evaluate some tools to find out the most suitable for their demands. 
Since they have multiple products and variants we’ll also investigate in a proper branching pattern suitable for their business.

\noindent The implementation plan will also include steps such as setting up a SCM policy and some guidelines for how SCM should be applied, this to make sure the SCM structure are being followed even after the implementation is finished.

\noindent The planned preliminary end result is a more organized, effective and well structured organization. The cost of having SCM shall be justified by having less problems. Overall it shall be beneficial to have SCM in the company, compared to not having it.
